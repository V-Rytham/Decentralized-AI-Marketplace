# 🧠 Decentralized AI Model Marketplace 🚀
🔗 A Blockchain-Powered AI Marketplace for Secure, Transparent, and Affordable AI Access
Welcome to the Decentralized AI Model Marketplace, where AI developers can list their models for rent or purchase, and users can access AI without relying on centralized big tech providers. Built on blockchain and decentralized storage, this platform ensures transparency, affordability, and data privacy.

## ⚡Features
-  ✅ Decentralized AI Model Hosting – AI models are stored securely on IPFS/Filecoin.
-  ✅ Fair & Affordable AI Access – Users can rent AI models without expensive API pricing.
-  ✅ NFT-Based Licensing – Ownership and rights are recorded on the blockchain.
-  ✅ Transparent Model Training Data – Metadata ensures users know what AI is trained on.
-  ✅ Decentralized Compute Power – AI models run on Akash/Golem, reducing cloud costs.
-  ✅ Crypto & Fiat Payments – Pay using ETH, USDT, or standard credit cards.
-  ✅ Web3 Authentication – Secure login via MetaMask or traditional sign-in.

## 🌎 How It Works?

1️⃣ **AI Developers Upload Their Models** 🛠️  
   - AI models are stored on **IPFS/Filecoin**.  
   - Metadata (training dataset, accuracy, etc.) is recorded on **blockchain**.  
   - Licensing is done via **NFTs**, ensuring ownership rights.  

2️⃣ **Users Browse & Rent AI Models** 🔍  
   - Users search for AI models (e.g., **fraud detection, image generation**).  
   - Pay per use **OR** rent the model for a specific time.  
   - Payments are processed via **crypto or fiat**.  

3️⃣ **AI Models Run on Decentralized Compute Power** ⚡  
   - Instead of relying on **expensive cloud servers**, AI runs on **Akash/Golem**.  
   - This reduces **hosting costs** and ensures **open access**.
